# Usability Test Plan

## Garden of Eden

### Purpose of the Usability Test

The purpose of this formative usability test is to evaluate the usability and functionality of the Garden of Eden app in its current development phase. The test aims to:
- Assess whether users can easily input their mood and answer the question of the day without confusion.
- Evaluate navigation through the journal list and the ability to edit journal entries.
- Test user understanding of the connection between mood input and the flower representation in the Garden of Eden.
- Identify usability issues and gather feedback to improve the app’s design and functionality.

### Target Audience

The target audience are individuals who:
- Are aged 18-75.
- Want to track their emotional progress & heal through journaling.
- Are interested in mental health, mindfulness, or self-improvement.

### Test Methodology

**Format**: The test will be conducted in person.

**Tools**:
- Note-taking
- Google Forms

**Moderator Role**:
- Guide participants through the test.
- Observe and document user behaviors, errors, and feedback.

### Heuristic Evaluation

Before conducting the usability test, a heuristic evaluation was performed by both of us on the app's initial mockups to identify potential usability issues. The evaluation used Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics, focusing on:

- **Visibility of system status**: Ensuring the app provides feedback for user actions.
- **Match between system and the real world**: Using intuitive representations like flowers for mood tracking.
- **Error prevention and recovery**: Prevent accidental deletions with a confirmation dialog.
- **Consistency and standards**: Ensuring uniform navigation and design patterns.

#### Key Findings from Heuristic Evaluation

- The flower representation could be well-received for its visual appeal, but users may need better explanations of its meaning.
- The journal editing/deletion flow could be improved by changing the layout structure.

#### Initial Hypotheses

- Users will find the mood input and flower visualization intuitive and engaging.
- Navigation and journal editing will be straightforward for most participants.
- Participants will encounter minor issues related to task flow or feature clarity.

#### Research Questions

- How effectively can users input their mood and answer the question of the day?
- Is the Garden of Eden’s flower representation of mood intuitive and meaningful to users?
- How easily can participants navigate the journal list and edit or delete entries?
- Are there specific areas of the app where users experience confusion or errors?

### Tasks

Participants will complete the following tasks during the usability test:

1. Open the app and complete the landing page (input your current mood and answer the question of the day).
2. Check the Garden of Eden to see which flower represents your mood.
3. Navigate to the journal list, find your entry, edit it by changing its text, and save your changes.
4. In your journal entry, please delete the entry.

### Post-Test Questions

Participants will answer the following questions:

1. What was your experience like when inputting your mood and answering the question of the day? Can you describe any challenges you faced?
2. How did you find navigating the journal list? What aspects were intuitive, and which ones were not?
3. Can you share your experience editing and saving a journal entry? What worked well, and what could be improved?
4. How did the Garden of Eden’s flower representation of your mood resonate with you? Did it align with your expectations?
5. Were there any specific features or parts of the app that you found frustrating or difficult to use? Can you elaborate?
6. How would you describe your overall experience with the app? What suggestions do you have for improvement?

### Data Collection and Dependent Variables

#### Dependent Variables

- **Task success rate**: Percentage of participants who complete the tasks.
- **Error rate**: The number of mistakes or confusions observed.
- **Satisfaction ratings**: Participant feedback on ease of use, collected via post-test surveys.

#### Data Collection Methods

- **Direct observation**: Documenting user actions, behaviors, and errors.
- **Post-test surveys**: Collecting feedback on task difficulty and overall app experience.
- **Think-aloud protocol**: Encouraging participants to verbalize their thoughts as they complete tasks.

### Usability Test Results

#### Key findings after the usability tests

1. **Edit/Save Confusion**: Users tapped the text field instead of the edit icon, finding the editing process unintuitive.
2. **Garden Interaction**: Many users were unclear about the meaning of the flowers, didn't resonate with their assigned flower, and initially overlooked the info button.
3. **Journal List Feedback**: Users expressed wanting the mood displayed alongside the question of the day in the journal list.
4. **Multiple Entries**: Participants wanted to add more than one journal entry per day.

#### App Updates Based on User Feedback

To address the issues identified during usability testing and improve the app, we carefully considered all feedback and implemented the following enhancements:

1. **Intuitive Edit/Save**: Users can now start typing immediately after clicking the edit icon, with toast messages indicating when editing starts or ends and background color changes.
2. **Better Flower Design**: The flower design is now more visually appealing, with a legend explaining each type.
3. **Flexible Entry Page**: Users can now either write freely or answer the "Question of the Day."
4. **Multiple Entries Per Day**: Users can add multiple entries in one day.
5. **Mood Display**: The journal card now shows the user’s mood.
6. **Improved Alert Dialogs**: Alert dialogs are clearer, keeping users informed.
