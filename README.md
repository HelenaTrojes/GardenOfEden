## Final Reflections

### Klarissa Breitkopf
Every code lab brings its own set of challenges, especially when you're trying to implement new and exciting features that you've never worked with before. Along the way, unexpected problems arise that can take hours to solve, making the process exhausting but also rewarding. For our project, one of the biggest challenges was settling on the design. We initially sketched a design, but we never created a high-fidelity prototype, which led to numerous UI changes as we started implementing features. This lack of a clear design direction caused a lot of confusion, especially with the color palette, and we found ourselves revisiting the design multiple times.

Eventually, we decided to create a Figma design, which made the rest of the development process smoother. From this experience, I learned that having a Figma design is essential for a clear vision of the app’s layout. Additionally, organizing the database structure at the beginning would have given us a better overview and made it easier to manage the data.

In this project, I was responsible for creating the icon image, which I designed on my iPad, as well as a tulip illustration that initially appeared in the first version of the app but was later replaced due to color mismatches. I also worked on the welcome screen, home screen with the garden section, designed the flowers, and implemented features such as displaying the landing screen once a day with the question of the day. I added functionalities like the delete button, helped with usability testing, set up documentation and the database. Furthermore, I ensured the app provided clear user feedback by adding for example confirmation messages where they were missing.

Overall, it was less stressful working on this project with another person, and I appreciate Helena Vishkurti for being such a great teammate. This experience taught me valuable lessons on the importance of design, organization, and teamwork, which I’ll apply to future projects.
