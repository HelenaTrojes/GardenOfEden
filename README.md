## Final Reflections

### Klarissa Breitkopf
Every code lab brings its own set of challenges, especially when you're trying to implement new and exciting features that you've never worked with before. Along the way, unexpected problems arise that can take hours to solve, making the process exhausting but also rewarding. For our project, one of the biggest challenges was settling on the design. We initially sketched a design, but we never created a high-fidelity prototype, which led to numerous UI changes as we started implementing features. This lack of a clear design direction caused a lot of confusion, especially with the color palette, and we found ourselves revisiting the design multiple times.

Eventually, we decided to create a Figma design, which made the rest of the development process smoother. From this experience, I learned that having a Figma design is essential for a clear vision of the app’s layout. Additionally, organizing the database structure at the beginning would have given us a better overview and made it easier to manage the data.

In this project, I was responsible for creating the icon image, which I designed on my iPad, as well as a tulip illustration that initially appeared in the first version of the app but was later replaced due to color mismatches. I also worked on the welcome screen, home screen with the garden section, designed the flowers, and implemented features such as displaying the landing screen once a day with the question of the day. I added functionalities like the delete button, helped with usability testing, set up documentation and the database. Furthermore, I ensured the app provided clear user feedback by adding for example confirmation messages where they were missing.

Overall, it was less stressful working on this project with another person, and I appreciate Helena Vishkurti for being such a great teammate. This experience taught me valuable lessons on the importance of design, organization, and teamwork, which I’ll apply to future projects.

This code lab has been one of the most enjoyable experiences for me so far. I really loved working on mobile app coding and design, and collaborating in a team made everything feel a lot more manageable. I think we did a great job meeting all the requirements from our initial concept, even though we ran into some challenges, especially with the UI/UX design. We kept going back and forth on things like the design layout and color palettes, but I think this iterative process helped us refine the details and incorporate the feedback we got during usability testing. Observing how users interacted with our app inspired me to add some small changes to make the overall user experience smoother and more enjoyable, and I documented these updates in detail as part of our final documentation.

My main contributions included designing and developing the landing screen, journal screen, and journal detail screen. I worked on both the user interface and functionalities, such as adding your mood and journal entries from the landing screen and editing your answer in the journal detail screen. The text field for editing journal answers was definitely one of the trickiest parts—I had to rewrite the code for it twice to get it to behave exactly how I envisioned it. But in the end, I’m really proud of how it turned out, as I believe it contributes to an excellent user experience and reflects the care and attention I poured into it. I also worked on the "Question of the Day" feature, where I created a list of 100 questions that show up one at a time each day and save the user’s answers in the database. It felt really satisfying to see this feature come together because it made the app feel more dynamic and personal.

Overall, this code lab was a fantastic experience where I gained valuable knowledge and confidence. It gave me the chance to debug, experiment, refine features based on the feedback we got from the usability tests, and apply concepts learned throughout the semester. This project has shown me that I can tackle new challenges without fear and that persistence always pays off.
